# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ruby fundamental repository. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [opensource@howtohireme.ru](mailto:opensource@howtohireme.ru).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner-friendly`, `good first issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner-friendly][good first issue] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Issues

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code (a.k.a. `master`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
